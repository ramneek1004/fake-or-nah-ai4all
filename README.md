# (UPDATE IN README.md) Fake or Nah

The purpose of our project was to create an accurate and efficient fake news detector using Natural Language Processing (NLP). After testing different identfiers that differentiate fake news from true news, we chose a linear regression model to train with our data. We used a dataset called fake-and-real-news-dataset found on Kaggle for this project. We employed advanced Python techniques and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Fake news has been a great problem, whether its purpose is to spread propaganda, misinformation or for another malicious intent. Our goal was to create a project that allows people to check the verity of their articles before believing their information.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Used over 44,000 articles to train a linear regression model with 99% accuracy
2. Identified 10 identifiers that are supported by the data we are using.

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
